# WIZARD7-SOEN341_Project_F24

## Project Overview
  The Peer Assessment Application is designed to help universities smooth up the peer evaluation process in team-based projects. The application addresses the common issues such as imbalanced contribution within teams, where individual efforts may not be recongnized.<br>
## Identified Problem
  In university team projects, assessing individual contributions is challenging. Without a formal system, students often felt that their efforts are either meaningless or unfairly judged. Therefore, this can lead to frustrations, lack of accountability, and poor team dynamics.<br>
## Proposed Solution
  The Peer Assessment Application enables students to annonymously evaluate their teammates accross multiple dimensions, such as cooperation, conceptual contribution, practical contribution and work ethic. By providing a structured platform for feedback, the application supported fairness, accountability, and personal growth. Instructors can also use this application to monitor team dynamics and individual contribution and performance to help them make informed assessments.<br>
## Project Details
  A peer assessment project. The product will allow students to assess their peers in group projects by evaluating their teammates' contributions. 
<br/>This system will require separate student and instructor login pages. Students will evaluate each other on a seven-point scale based on the four key dimensions: cooperation, conceptual contribution, practical contribution, and work ethic.
<br/>Instructors will have the ability to create teams view the detailed peer evaluations, and export the results as a CSV file.

## Features
-  User Authentication: Students and Instructors can log in with distincted roles.
-  Team Management: Instructors can create teams and enable to group the students.
-  Peer Assessment: Students can rate their teammates annonymously on a scale of 7-points based on four key dimensions.
-  Automated Score Sharing: Instructors received overall assessment results, and students receive anoymous peer feedback.
-  Instrutor Dashboard: A dashboard for instructors to view detailed peer assessment results by each team and stuends with export functionality.

## 4 Assessment Dimensions:
-  Cooperation: Active participation, communication, teamwork, and assistance.
-  Conceptual Contribution: Research. quality of ideas, and problem-solving.

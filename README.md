# WIZARD7-SOEN341_Project_F24

A peer assessment project. The product will allow students to assess their peers in group projects by evaluating their teammates' contributions. 
<br/>This system will require separate student and instructor login pages. Students will  evaluate each other based on cooperation, conceptual contribution, practical contribution, and work ethic on a seven-point scale.
<br/>Instructors will have the ability to create teams and view the detailed peer evaluations, and export the results as a CSV file.

# WIZARD7-SOEN341_Project_F24

## Project Overview
  The Peer Assessment Application is an innovative web-based tool developed to address the challenges associated with evaluating individual contributions in team-based university projects. In academic environments, teamwork is essential, but it can often lead to uneven participation, misunderstandings, and unfair grading if proper tools to track and assess individual efforts are not in place. This application is designed to mitigate these issues by enabling students to provide anonymous, structured evaluations of their peer's contributions across 4 assessment dimensions. The system fosters accountability, enhances transparency, and offers actionable insights to both students and instructors, leading to a more balanced and effective team work experience.<br>
## Identified Problem
  In university team projects, assessing individual contributions is challenging. Without a formal system, students often felt that their efforts are either meaningless or unfairly judged. Therefore, this can lead to frustrations, lack of accountability, and poor team dynamics.<br>
## Proposed Solution
  The Peer Assessment Application enables students to annonymously evaluate their teammates accross multiple dimensions, such as cooperation, conceptual contribution, practical contribution and work ethic. By providing a structured platform for feedback, the application supported fairness, accountability, and personal growth. Instructors can also use this application to monitor team dynamics and individual contribution and performance to help them make informed assessments.<br>
## Project Details
  The Peer Assessment Application is a web-based tool that enables students to evaluate their peers in group projects, promoting accountability and fair grading. The system will provide separate login portals for students and instructors, ensuring role-based access to the appropriate features. Students will log in to evaluate their teammates’ contributions based on four key dimensions: cooperation, conceptual contribution, practical contribution, and work ethic. These evaluations will be performed on a seven-point scale, where students can anonymously assess how well their peers participated in meetings, contributed ideas, completed tasks, and adhered to deadlines. The anonymity of the system encourages students to provide honest and constructive feedback, ensuring that evaluations are transparent and free from bias. <br>
  <br>
  Instructors will have their own portal to manage the assessment process. They will be able to create teams by manually assigning students or importing a CSV file, and they can monitor the evaluation process by accessing detailed reports on team performance. The system will aggregate the evaluation scores and generate performance summaries for each student, allowing instructors to easily track how individuals contribute to group efforts. Additionally, instructors will have the option to export the peer evaluation data in CSV format, facilitating integration with their grading systems. <br>
  <br>
  The application’s core functionalities include user authentication, team management, anonymous peer evaluations, and the ability to generate reports and export data. This structured approach ensures that individual contributions are fairly assessed, improving teamwork and enhancing the overall learning experience. By providing both students and instructors with valuable insights into team dynamics, the Peer Assessment Application fosters transparency and fairness in group-based academic projects.

## Features

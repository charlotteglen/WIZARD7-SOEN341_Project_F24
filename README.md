# WIZARD7-SOEN341_Project_F24
## Objective
  Design and execute a fidelity prototype that could serve as the basis for A Peer Assessment System for university team projects to evaluate the contributions and performance of their team members.
## Project
  The primary goal of this project is to develop a high-fidelity prototype that can be seamlessly transformed into a functional product for the online marketplace. With the rapid advancement of technology, online shopping has become an essential service for many consumers. As a result, the demand for robust online platforms that support e-commerce continues to grow.

<br/>This project aims to create a user-friendly interface (UI) that facilitates the sale of a wide range of real-life products while providing a satisfying browsing experience for users.

A Peer Assessment System for university team projects is designed to allow students to evaluate the contributions and performance of their teammates based on four key dimensions: cooperation, conceptual contribution, practical contribution, and work ethic. The system promotes accountability and provides valuable feedback to both students and instructors on team dynamics and individual efforts.

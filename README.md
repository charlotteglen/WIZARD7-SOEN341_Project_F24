# WIZARD7-SOEN341_Project_F24
## Objective
  Design and execute a fidelity prototype that could serve as the basis for A Peer Assessment System for university team projects to evaluate the contributions and performance of their team members.
## Project
  A peer assessment project. The product will allow students to assess their peers in group projects by evaluating their teammates' contributions. 
<br/>This system will require separate student and instructor login pages. Students will evaluate each other on a seven-point scale based on the four key dimensions: cooperation, conceptual contribution, practical contribution, and work ethic.
<br/>Instructors will have the ability to create teams view the detailed peer evaluations, and export the results as a CSV file.
